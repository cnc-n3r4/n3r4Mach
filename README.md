# n3r4Mach

**Modular CNC tooling utilities** — built to support machinists, programmers, and automation teams with a simple local interface that runs entirely on your own machine.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

n3r4Mach is a machinist-focused toolkit that brings together CNC calculators, reference libraries, program analyzers, and G-code tools into a single, easy-to-use desktop app — powered by Python, and presented in a clean, browser-style interface.

It supports:
- Tool remapping with collision protection
- Macro calculator tools
- Future drill/tap analyzers, backplotting, and more

---

## 💡 Technologies

- Python + Eel
- HTML/CSS + Tailwind
- Local-first, no server setup required

---

## 👥 Special Thanks

Huge thanks to [@SohaFarhana05](https://github.com/SohaFarhana05) for jump-starting the interface and contributing the calculator :)

## 🚀 How to Use

### 1. 📦 Install Requirements
Run this in your terminal:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. ▶️ Launch the App
Start the Eel app locally:
```
python eel_app/app.py
```

### 3. 🧰 Use the Tools

- **Remap Tool:** Drag and drop a `.nc` file and reassign tool numbers safely.
- **Calculator:** Basic trig and machining calculations.
- More utilities are planned — like a backplot viewer and cycle analyzers.

> No internet required. Runs locally in a desktop browser window.

## 🧩 Requirements

Make sure you have the following Python packages installed:
- `eel`
- `pyperclip`
- `flask`
- `filetype`
- `watchdog`
- `pandas`

If you're using a fresh Python environment, just run:

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
- Modular tools (each in their own folder)
- UI dropdown/tabs to switch modes
- Drag-and-drop NC file support
- Build scripts for generating `.exe` apps for Windows users
